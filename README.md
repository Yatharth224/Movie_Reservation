# 🎬 Movie Reservation System (OTP Based)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Movie Reservation System** is a simple and user-friendly web application that allows users to book movie tickets **without online payment**.

This system is specially designed for users who **do not trust online payments** or feel insecure about payment failures.  
Instead of payment, bookings are confirmed using an **OTP (One Time Password)** system.
